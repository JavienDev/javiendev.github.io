So, I've recently bought a laptop for the purposes of development. Which opens me the lovely opportunity of getting to use purely linux since I won't be doing any gaming on this machine.

So for my distro of choice, I chose Arch for a few reasons. 
- I've used it on my main PC for a bit, before having to run back to Windows to play games with anti-cheat...
- I like the philosophy and freedom of the barebones arch install, a freedom to create whatever you want, however you want.

But beyond that, I just wanted to be able to say "I use arch, btw".

So I ended up with a barebones Arch install and then I tried KDE plasma for a couple of days before stumbling across a productivity video on youtube, and remember that linux has probably the best tiling and window managers out there, so I started looking into them.

I ended up going with Hyprland, mostly because it was the first one that I actually looked at, so that was an easy choice. I fetched the USB and completely wiped my KDE arch install and started from scratch again.

For the Hyprland installation, I found this amazing github repo that probably everyone already knows called [Arch-Hyprland](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland 'Arch-Hyprland') by **JaKooLit**, and I can't underestimate how much this helped a newbie like myself when getting Hyprland to quickly look and feel like I had been using it for years, all the keybinds and setups just make sense.

So far I've loved my experience on Arch, even more so that I did on my main computer, and once the anti-cheat situation gets better or I get bored of the games that have it, I will finally move to linux fully.
