So ever since **Mr.Musk** has consumed the platform of twitter, I've deleted my 8 year old account on the site. Not that Twitter needed even needed Elon for me to do this, but I just realized that the content I was consuming and seeing on the website was full of a bunch of "troll" accounts pushing random content and then begging for likes in the comments.

Or this god awful "Like to see the new like animation"... So i've looked else where for my quick needs of public approval. Bluesky.

Which I hope to become a place for me to share my passion and hopefully get some feedback on what I am working on.

If someone is reading this blog, please DM me on blsky at **@javiendev.bsky.social**. Would be fun to see if anybody is reading my blogs.

I will also try to update a blog post more often, about different topics I find interesting, one of which is my Diagnosis of Aspergers, but i'll write about that another time. ðŸ˜…

Thanks for reading!
